# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis for Diabetes Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates Multiple Linear Regression analysis using the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.

## Overview

This notebook focuses on building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict diabetes progression based on multiple features from the diabetes dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Files

- `Multiple_Linear_Regression_Diabetes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Notebook Contents

1. **Importing Libraries**: Imports necessary libraries for data analysis and model building.
2. **Loading and Preparing Data**: Loads the diabetes dataset, prepares the data for modeling, and showcases initial data exploration.
3. **Data Splitting**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
4. **Model Training and Prediction**: Utilizes Multiple Linear Regression to train a model and make predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizes the actual vs. predicted values to assess model performance.
6. **Model Coefficients**: Displays the coefficients and intercept of the Multiple Linear Regression model.
7. **Model Accuracy Evaluation**: Calculates the R-squared (R2) score as a measure of model accuracy.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Open `ML_Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to observe the step-by-step analysis and results.
